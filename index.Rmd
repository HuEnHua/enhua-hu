I am an economist specializing in **decision theory**. Questions I am interested in: how do people process information? How do they choose between complex options? I investigate these through theoretical and experimental methods. 

Currently, I am a PhD Candidate at the  [University of Toronto](https://www.economics.utoronto.ca/index.php/index/index) under the supervision of [Yoram Halevy](https://yoram-halevy.faculty.economics.utoronto.ca/) and [Colin Stewart](http://individual.utoronto.ca/colinstewart/). Previously, I completed a M.Sc in Economics and Philosophy at the LSE and a B.Sc in Economics, Mathematics and Philosophy at the University of Toronto.
